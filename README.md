# Caleb Fedyshen’s Blogthing

Your problem, solved with software. Styled like it’s 1997.

This is the code for my [personal blog](https://yourusername.github.io/) where I write about:
- software development and data architecture
- university advice for CS students
- job hunting, internships, and tech careers
- anything else I feel like yelling into the starfield void

The site uses:
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Plain HTML and CSS (with a strong 90s aesthetic)
- Tiled backgrounds, `<marquee>`, 88×31 buttons, and no JavaScript

## Posts

All blog posts live in the [`/posts`](posts/) directory. Each post is a standalone HTML file.

## Layout

- The center column is the main blog post list
- The left sidebar is a reading list with links to favorite articles, videos, and books
- The right sidebar is reserved for projects (coming soon)

On narrow screens, the layout reflows to a vertical stack: blog → projects → reading list.

## Tools and Assets

- Hosted with GitHub Pages
- No build process or framework
- Retro assets from:
  - [vilgacx/88x31](https://github.com/vilgacx/88x31)
  - [aharris88/retro-assets](https://github.com/aharris88/retro-assets)
