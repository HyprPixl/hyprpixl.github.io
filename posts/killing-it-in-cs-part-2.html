<p><strong>Killing it in computer science (and other disciplines) part 2:</strong></p>

<p>Everyone hates group projects. Take advantage of them to make connections with people in your classes. My closest uni friends all came from working together.</p>

<p>The thing you enjoy the most is the easiest to learn, take some time in your first semesters to sample as wide a variety of classes as possible.</p>

<p>As well, in each class find the things that interest you the most and spend a little extra time learning about them. It’ll take almost no extra effort and the gains will compound over your degree. Eg. if you liked your computer networks class; set up a home server on a Raspberry PI. If you liked your security class, write a hacking tool. The things you do on your own are what make you dangerous in the job market.</p>

<p>Here is the <strong>GOLDEN NUGGET</strong>: Treat university like a free trial period where the downside risk of being ambitious is as low as it will ever be, and the upside potential is as high as possible because you have time on your side. Try the business idea, join the university club and rise to the top, <strong>THE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a senior student or someone who has completed a degree, pay it forward and drop some wisdom in the comments. I know I would have appreciated it a few years ago.</p>
