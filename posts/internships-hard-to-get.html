<p>Internships are hard to get. Here is my first set of tips on how to get yours:</p>

<p>The <strong>MOST IMPORTANT</strong> thing you can do is talk to everyone you know who works at any company and ask if they know about any internships happening there, ask about teams they know people on, ask about where they think you’d be the best fit. Finally, ask if they’d be a reference or do a referral. This, more than anything, will increase your odds of getting an interview.</p>

<p>This one will seem like a hot take – don’t even bother with LinkedIn quick apply. The jobs that do that get <strong>THOUSANDS</strong> of applicants; you will not stand out. I posted a job looking for someone to help me out on a software job early this year and got two-and-a-half-thousand applications in two days. The odds of your resume even getting looked at are minimal.</p>

<p>Instead, apply on company websites (I know it’s annoying to fill out the hundredth Workday form with the same stuff) – the higher barrier of entry shrinks the pool of applicants <strong>SIGNIFICANTLY</strong>. This is also the place you can include the referral from the first tip.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting plenty more of these with all the things I’ve learned over the last four years, so be sure to follow for more. My next one will detail the <em>WORST</em> ways to use AI in the application process.</p>
