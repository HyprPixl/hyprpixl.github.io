<p>Expensive enterprise software is dying, and I saved <strong>$70k per month</strong> by killing it. Here’s the thing: there are 9.8 million bank check images that Plains needs to retrieve accurately and with ease—that's 4.9 million checks front and back! Image Viewer (an app from a retail bank) is a <em>legacy</em> piece of software that lets companies find and view bank cheques. Unfortunately (or fortunately for me) it is being phased out and the replacement is charged on a per retrieval basis. The estimated cost of this new software, for Plains All American, is seventy thousand dollars a month! This is where I come in: I built an app that lets the treasury team do exactly this, from the data pipeline to the front end, and it costs only a few hundred dollars a month. My app entirely replaces Image Viewer, does the job quicker, and automates manual steps. I learned a ton building this and am absolutely certain there are countless opportunities like this across all businesses from big to small.</p>

<p>On the technical side, the app was built in Python Flask with a Html + Css + JS frontend, and the data pipeline involved multithreaded extraction of terabytes of images from thousands of zip files, parsing millions of entries from xml into a database, and setting that all to run incrementally so the information is always up to date. The app was deployed on the Databricks Apps platform, which I highly recommend checking out if your company runs Databricks at all.</p>
