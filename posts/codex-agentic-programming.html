<p>Open AI's Codex agentic programming system has been adding features to my blog in the background, while I worked on... well, my actual work. My blog now has another hidden easter egg! A terminal emulator built in that lets you navigate the site and get a fortune told, among other functions. Access it by hitting shift tilde or with the link in the bottom corner. </p>

<p>So far Codex has done almost all the programming, and let me focus on the ideas. I know it seems scary for some people, but to me the best path forward is to learn every new technology quickly and use it as a force multiplier. Codex still shares the base model's limitations on complex problems but can carry out tasks on its own. It will only get better from here — I'm already feeling the AGI lol.</p>
