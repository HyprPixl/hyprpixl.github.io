<p>The three best strategies for killing a computer science degree are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Talk to someone in each class in the first or second lecture.</strong>  
      This will set you up with a group member or study buddy, and by the time you are in your second year you’ll have ten classmates you can talk to and take on the degree with. I know it’s uncomfortable, but the truth is everyone is looking for a buddy in the first week of classes anyway. Do this every single semester.</li>

  <li><strong>Go to class and do the practice problems.</strong><br>
      I know this seems obvious, but the people I’ve seen fail classes or drop out of the program all failed to do this – the bare minimum.</li>

  <li><strong>Get started early.</strong>  
      As soon as you have the required info to do an assignment, start it. You <em>WILL GET STUCK</em> on hard problems and if you can get your brain cooking on a solution early, you will have a much easier time. It will become a background task and you’ll probably figure it out in the shower or in a dream (this has actually happened twice).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> know when good enough is good enough – sometimes that extra two percent on the grade isn’t worth twice the work. Part of the reason I felt so burned out after first year was that I hadn’t realized this yet.</p>

<p>If you have more good ones, send them my way :)</p>
