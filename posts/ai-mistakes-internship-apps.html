<p>I have seen terrible ways people use chatGPT to try to get an internship/job. Here are the ones that will hurt you the most and how to fix it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you apply for a job on this website, you’ll likely get prompted to send an auto-generated message to the recruiter. <strong>NEVER</strong> do it. When the recruiter receives the two-hundredth message that opens with the same sentence, they’re not gonna have a positive association with your name. Instead, if you feel like reaching out: engage with some of their content, send them a message about something it made you think about, and let them know you applied. You’re just trying to get them to recognize your name when they see your application, that’s all!</li>

  <li>You might be tempted to auto-generate cover letters for applications; the problem is after a certain amount of time reading AI-generated text you get a “smell” for it. If you’re not confident your cover letter doesn’t smell like AI, don’t send it in. Do however write your own and get ChatGPT to critique it, or even better: paste the job description in and your resume and your cover letter and ask how you can make your letter shine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know hunting for a position stinks, but this and my previous post should help you land it! Follow along for more in the coming days!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> use AI to increase the value of your internship application, <em>not</em> to replace the value of it.</p>

<p>P.S. I didn’t use AI on this post</p>
